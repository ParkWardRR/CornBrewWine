## Corn-Based Beverage Brewing Playbook

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for brewing three distinct corn-based beverages: Sparkling Corn Beverage, Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, and Non-Hopped Corn Brew. Each recipe aims for specific alcohol content and a clean, refreshing taste.

### Ingredients

- Corn: 7.5 lbs total
- Malted Barley: 1.5 lbs total
- Wheat: 0.9 lbs total
- Hops: 0.5 oz Cascade hops (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)
- Champagne Yeast: For Sparkling Corn Beverage
- Ale Yeast: For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew
- Neutral Yeast: For Non-Hopped Corn Brew
- Priming Sugar: 0.75 cups total
- Water: Approximately 4.5 gallons total
- Glucoamylase Enzyme: Optional, to aid in starch conversion

### Equipment

- Heavy-Duty Growlers: Three growlers rated for pressure
- Large Pot (Brew Kettle): For mashing and boiling
- Fermenters: Three 1-gallon glass jugs or plastic buckets with airlocks
- Thermometers: To monitor mash temperatures
- Hydrometers: To measure specific gravity
- Siphons/Tubing: For transferring liquids
- Sanitizer: To clean and sanitize all equipment

### Brewing Process

1. **Preparation and Mashing**
   - Clean and sanitize all equipment thoroughly.
   - Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
   - Combine corn, malted barley, and wheat in a large pot.
   - Heat water to 162째F (72째C) and add to the grains, maintaining a mash temperature of 148째F (64째C) for 60 minutes.

2. **Determining the Need for Glucoamylase Enzyme**
   - After 30 minutes of mashing, perform an iodine test by placing a small sample of wort on a white plate and adding a drop of iodine solution.
   - If the iodine turns blue/purple, indicating incomplete starch conversion, consider adding glucoamylase enzyme to aid in the process.
   - If the iodine remains amber, starch conversion is complete, and the enzyme is not needed.

3. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**
   - Continue monitoring starch conversion with periodic iodine tests until the iodine remains amber, indicating complete conversion.

4. **Boiling and Hopping (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)**
   - Boil the mash and add 0.5 oz Cascade hops during the last 15 minutes to extract aroma without excessive bitterness.

5. **Cooling and Fermentation Preparation**
   - Cool the mash to room temperature.
   - Measure the Original Gravity (OG) using a hydrometer to ensure it aligns with your target:
     - Aim for an OG of 1.080 for wine-like strength (10-12% ABV).
     - Aim for an OG of 1.050 for brew-like strength (5-7% ABV).
   - Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach the desired OG.
   - Divide the cooled mash into three equal portions.

6. **Fermentation**
   - Add Champagne yeast to the first portion, Ale yeast to the second, and Neutral yeast to the third.
   - Transfer each portion into separate fermenters with airlocks.
   - Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature appropriate for the yeast strain used.
   - Use fresh, healthy yeast and pitch the correct amount.
   - Allow fermentation to proceed until specific gravity stabilizes.

7. **Measuring and Aiming for Final Gravity (FG)**
   - Once fermentation is complete, measure the Final Gravity (FG) using a hydrometer.
   - For Sparkling Corn Beverage, aim for an FG that achieves 10-12% ABV.
   - For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, aim for an FG that achieves 5-7% ABV.
   - For Non-Hopped Corn Brew, aim for an FG that achieves 5-7% ABV.
   - If FG is not within the desired range, consider adjusting fermentation conditions, such as temperature or yeast health, in future batches.

8. **Priming and Bottling**
   - Add priming sugar to each fermented portion.
   - Carefully siphon each portion into a heavy-duty growler, leaving sediment behind to avoid trub and sediment transfer.
   - Seal each growler tightly.

9. **Conditioning**
   - Store growlers in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks to allow carbonation to develop.
   - Check pressure periodically to ensure safe carbonation levels.

10. **Serving**
    - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the growlers in the refrigerator.
    - Serve cold to minimize foaming when opening.

By following these steps, you can brew high-quality corn-based beverages with precise alcohol content and a clean, refreshing taste. Enjoy your brewing journey!

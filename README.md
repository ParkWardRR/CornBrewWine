## Corn-Based Beverage Brewing Playbook

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for brewing Sparkling Corn Beverage, Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, and Non-Hopped Corn Brew. Each recipe is designed to achieve specific alcohol content and a clean, refreshing taste.

### Total Ingredients (For 1.5 Gallons Total Yield)

- **Crisp Flaked Corn (Torrefied Maize)**: 16 oz
- **Briess Flaked Barley (Unmalted)**: 8 oz
- **Flaked White Wheat**: 8 oz
- **Liberty Hops Pellets**: 0.17 oz (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)
- **Champagne Yeast (White Labs WLP715)**: For Sparkling Corn Beverage
- **Cream Ale Yeast Blend (White Labs WLP080)**: For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew
- **Priming Sugar**: Approximately 0.75 oz (21 g)
- **Water**: Approximately 1.5 gallons
- **Glucoamylase Enzyme**: Optional, to aid in starch conversion

### Equipment

- **Bottles**: 750ml bottles
- **Large Pot (Brew Kettle)**: 8-quart capacity
- **Fermenters**: Sized to accommodate 750ml batches
- **Thermometers**: To monitor mash temperatures
- **Hydrometers**: To measure specific gravity
- **Siphons/Tubing**: For transferring liquids
- **Sanitizer**: To clean and sanitize all equipment

### Brewing Process

1. **Preparation and Mashing**
   - Clean and sanitize all equipment thoroughly.
   - Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
   - Combine 16 oz of Crisp Flaked Corn, 8 oz of Briess Flaked Barley, and 8 oz of Flaked White Wheat in the brew pot.
   - Heat 1.5 gallons of water to 162째F (72째C) and add to the grains, maintaining a mash temperature of 148째F (64째C) for 60 minutes.

2. **Determining the Need for Glucoamylase Enzyme**
   - After 30 minutes of mashing, perform an iodine test by placing a small sample of wort on a white plate and adding a drop of iodine solution.
   - If the iodine turns blue/purple, indicating incomplete starch conversion, consider adding glucoamylase enzyme.
   - If the iodine remains amber, starch conversion is complete.

3. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**
   - Continue monitoring starch conversion with periodic iodine tests until the iodine remains amber.

4. **Boiling and Hopping (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)**
   - Boil the mash and add 0.17 oz Liberty hops during the last 15 minutes.

5. **Cooling and Fermentation Preparation**
   - Cool the mash to room temperature.
   - Measure the Original Gravity (OG) using a hydrometer:
     - Aim for an OG of 1.080 for wine-like strength (10-12% ABV).
     - Aim for an OG of 1.050 for brew-like strength (5-7% ABV).
   - Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach the desired OG.
   - Divide the cooled mash into three 750ml portions.

6. **Yeast Pitching**
   - Add Champagne yeast (WLP715) to the first portion for Sparkling Corn Beverage.
   - Add Cream Ale yeast blend (WLP080) to the second portion for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew.

7. **Fermentation**
   - Transfer each portion into separate fermenters with airlocks.
   - Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature appropriate for the yeast strain used.
   - Allow fermentation to proceed until specific gravity stabilizes.

8. **Measuring and Aiming for Final Gravity (FG)**
   - Once fermentation is complete, measure the Final Gravity (FG) using a hydrometer.
   - For Sparkling Corn Beverage, aim for an FG that achieves 10-12% ABV.
   - For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, aim for an FG that achieves 5-7% ABV.

9. **Priming and Bottling**
   - Add 0.75 oz of priming sugar to the entire batch.
   - Carefully siphon each portion into 750ml bottles, leaving sediment behind.
   - Seal each bottle tightly.

10. **Conditioning**
    - Store bottles in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks for carbonation.
    - Check pressure periodically.

11. **Serving**
    - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the bottles in the refrigerator.
    - Serve cold to minimize foaming.

### Bottling

For a total yield of 1.5 gallons, you will need approximately 6 bottles of 750ml each. Adjust the number of bottles based on the exact yield and desired serving size.

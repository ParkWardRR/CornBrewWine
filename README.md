## Corn-Based Beverage Brewing Playbook

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for brewing Sparkling Corn Beverage, Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, and Non-Hopped Corn Brew. Each recipe is designed to achieve specific alcohol content and a clean, refreshing taste.

### Total Ingredients

- **Corn**: 7.5 lbs
- **Malted Barley**: 1.5 lbs
- **Wheat**: 0.9 lbs
- **Hops**: 0.5 oz Cascade hops (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)
- **Champagne Yeast**: For Sparkling Corn Beverage
- **Ale Yeast**: For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew
- **Neutral Yeast**: For Non-Hopped Corn Brew
- **Priming Sugar**: 0.75 cups
- **Water**: Approximately 4.5 gallons
- **Glucoamylase Enzyme**: Optional, to aid in starch conversion

### Equipment

- **Bottles**: 750ml bottles
- **Large Pot (Brew Kettle)**: At least 6.75-gallon capacity
- **Fermenters**: Sized to accommodate 750ml batches
- **Thermometers**: To monitor mash temperatures
- **Hydrometers**: To measure specific gravity
- **Siphons/Tubing**: For transferring liquids
- **Sanitizer**: To clean and sanitize all equipment

### Brewing Process

1. **Preparation and Mashing**
   - Clean and sanitize all equipment thoroughly.
   - Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
   - Combine 7.5 lbs of corn, 1.5 lbs of malted barley, and 0.9 lbs of wheat in a large pot.
   - Heat 4.5 gallons of water to 162°F (72°C) and add to the grains, maintaining a mash temperature of 148°F (64°C) for 60 minutes.

2. **Determining the Need for Glucoamylase Enzyme**
   - After 30 minutes of mashing, perform an iodine test by placing a small sample of wort on a white plate and adding a drop of iodine solution.
   - If the iodine turns blue/purple, indicating incomplete starch conversion, consider adding glucoamylase enzyme.
   - If the iodine remains amber, starch conversion is complete.

3. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**
   - Continue monitoring starch conversion with periodic iodine tests until the iodine remains amber.

4. **Boiling and Hopping (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)**
   - Boil the mash and add 0.5 oz Cascade hops during the last 15 minutes.

5. **Cooling and Fermentation Preparation**
   - Cool the mash to room temperature.
   - Measure the Original Gravity (OG) using a hydrometer:
     - Aim for an OG of 1.080 for wine-like strength (10-12% ABV).
     - Aim for an OG of 1.050 for brew-like strength (5-7% ABV).
   - Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach the desired OG.
   - Divide the cooled mash into three 750ml portions.

6. **Yeast Pitching**

   - **Determine Original Gravity (OG)**
     - For a **wine-like strength** (10-12% ABV), aim for an OG of 1.080.
     - For a **brew-like strength** (5-7% ABV), aim for an OG of 1.050.

   - **Calculate Pitch Rate**
     - Convert the OG to degrees Plato (°P) using the formula: 
       $$ \text{Degrees Plato} = (\text{OG} - 1) \times 1000 / 4 $$
     - For example, an OG of 1.050 is approximately 12.5 °P.

   - **Determine Yeast Cells Needed**
     - **Ale Yeast**: Multiply 0.75 million cells by the volume in milliliters and the °P.
     - **Wine Yeast**: Use one packet per 5 gallons. For smaller batches like 750ml, using a whole packet ensures a healthy fermentation.

   - **Practical Application**
     - **For Sparkling Corn Beverage (Champagne Yeast)**: Use one packet per 5 gallons. For a 750ml batch, using a whole packet is still recommended.
     - **For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew (Ale Yeast)**: Calculate based on the °P and volume. For 750ml at 12.5 °P, this would be approximately 9.375 million cells needed. Use a yeast calculator or a whole packet for simplicity.
     - **For Non-Hopped Corn Brew (Neutral Yeast)**: Similar to ale yeast, calculate based on °P and volume or use a whole packet for ease.

7. **Fermentation**
   - Add Champagne yeast to the first portion, Ale yeast to the second, and Neutral yeast to the third.
   - Transfer each portion into separate fermenters with airlocks.
   - Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature appropriate for the yeast strain used.
   - Allow fermentation to proceed until specific gravity stabilizes.

8. **Measuring and Aiming for Final Gravity (FG)**
   - Once fermentation is complete, measure the Final Gravity (FG) using a hydrometer.
   - For Sparkling Corn Beverage, aim for an FG that achieves 10-12% ABV.
   - For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew and Non-Hopped Corn Brew, aim for an FG that achieves 5-7% ABV.

9. **Priming and Bottling**
   - Add 0.75 cups of priming sugar to the entire batch.
   - Carefully siphon each portion into 750ml bottles, leaving sediment behind.
   - Seal each bottle tightly.

10. **Conditioning**
    - Store bottles in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks for carbonation.
    - Check pressure periodically.

11. **Serving**
    - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the bottles in the refrigerator.
    - Serve cold to minimize foaming.

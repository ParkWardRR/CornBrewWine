## Ingredients

- **Corn**: 7.5 lbs total
- **Malted Barley**: 1.5 lbs total
- **Wheat**: 0.9 lbs total
- **Hops**: 0.5 oz Cascade hops (for Lightly Hopped Corn Brew)
- **Champagne Yeast**: For Sparkling Corn Beverage
- **Ale Yeast**: For Lightly Hopped Corn Brew
- **Neutral Yeast**: For Non-Hopped Corn Brew
- **Priming Sugar**: 0.75 cups total
- **Water**: Approximately 4.5 gallons total
- **Glucoamylase Enzyme**: Optional, to aid in starch conversion

## Equipment

- **Heavy-Duty Growlers**: Three growlers rated for pressure
- **Large Pot (Brew Kettle)**: For mashing and boiling
- **Fermenters**: Three 1-gallon glass jugs or plastic buckets with airlocks
- **Thermometers**: To monitor mash temperatures
- **Hydrometers**: To measure specific gravity
- **Siphons/Tubing**: For transferring liquids
- **Sanitizer**: To clean and sanitize all equipment

## Brewing Process

1. **Mashing**:
   - Combine corn, malted barley, and wheat in a large pot.
   - Heat water to 162째F (72째C) and maintain the mash at 148째F (64째C) for 60 minutes.
   - Optionally, add glucoamylase to ensure complete conversion of starches.

2. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**:
   - Perform an iodine test by placing a small sample of wort on a white plate and adding a drop of iodine solution.
   - If the iodine turns blue/purple, extend the mash time and re-test until the iodine remains amber, indicating complete conversion.

3. **Fermentation**:
   - Divide the mash into three equal portions.
   - Add Champagne yeast to the first portion, Ale yeast to the second, and Neutral yeast to the third.
   - Allow each to ferment in separate fermenters until specific gravity stabilizes.

4. **Alcohol Content Targeting**:
   - Use a hydrometer to measure Original Gravity (OG) before fermentation and Final Gravity (FG) after fermentation.
   - Aim for an OG of 1.080 for wine-like strength (10-12% ABV) and 1.050 for brew-like strength (5-7% ABV).
   - Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach desired OG.

5. **Hopping Techniques**:
   - For the Lightly Hopped Corn Brew, add hops during the last 15 minutes of the boil to extract aroma without excessive bitterness.
   - Avoid prolonged boiling of hops to prevent grassy or off-flavors.

6. **Priming and Bottling**:
   - Add priming sugar to each portion.
   - Carefully siphon each fermented portion into a heavy-duty growler, leaving sediment behind.
   - Seal each growler tightly.

7. **Conditioning**:
   - Store growlers in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks to allow carbonation to develop.
   - Check pressure periodically to ensure safe carbonation levels.

8. **Serving**:
   - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the growlers in the refrigerator.
   - Serve cold to minimize foaming when opening.

## Ensuring a Clean Taste

1. **Thorough Cleaning and Sanitization**: Clean all equipment thoroughly and sanitize immediately before use.
2. **Use Quality Water**: Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
3. **Control Fermentation Temperature**: Maintain a consistent temperature appropriate for the yeast strain used.
4. **Yeast Health and Pitching Rate**: Use fresh, healthy yeast and pitch the correct amount.
5. **Avoid Trub and Sediment**: Siphon carefully to avoid transferring sediment into the growlers.

By following this comprehensive playbook, you can brew high-quality corn-based beverages with precise alcohol content and a clean, refreshing taste. Enjoy your brewing journey!

### Brewing Process

1. **Preparation and Mashing**
   - Clean and sanitize all equipment thoroughly.
   - Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
   - Combine the grains for each batch as listed above in the brew pot.
   - Add rice hulls if necessary to prevent a stuck mash.
   - Heat 6 gallons of water to 162째F (72째C) and add to the grains, maintaining a mash temperature of 148째F (64째C) for 60 minutes.

2. **Brewing Batches**
   - For Batch 1, brew as an unmalted brew with specified grain ratios, including a Champagne yeast variation for a wine-like profile. Increase sugar content to achieve a higher alcohol content similar to wine or Champagne.
   - For Batch 2, brew with malt and oats to achieve a hazy IPA feel. Lactose addition is included for added body.
   - For Batch 3, repeat Batch 1 for consistency.
   - For Batch 4, brew a malted version with the specified grain ratios.

3. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**
   - Perform periodic iodine tests to ensure complete starch conversion.

4. **Dividing the Recipe**
   - Divide the mash into separate containers for hopping and non-hopping processes.

5. **Boiling and Hopping**
   - Boil the mash and add Liberty hops during the last 15 minutes for the hopped versions.

6. **Cooling and Fermentation Preparation**
   - Cool the mash to room temperature.
   - Measure the Original Gravity (OG) using a hydrometer. Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach the desired OG for higher alcohol content in the wine-like variation.
   - Divide the cooled mash into portions for fermentation preparation.

7. **Yeast Pitching and Fermentation**
   - Add appropriate yeast to each batch and ferment separately. For the Champagne yeast variation, ensure a longer fermentation period for higher alcohol content.

8. **Priming and Bottling**
   - Add priming sugar to the entire batch when bottling. Carefully siphon each portion into 750ml bottles, leaving sediment behind.

9. **Conditioning**
   - Store bottles in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks for carbonation. Check pressure periodically.

10. **Serving**
    - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the bottles in the refrigerator and serve cold to minimize foaming.

### Equipment Needed

- **Bottles**: 750ml bottles
- **Large Pot (Brew Kettle)**: 8-quart capacity
- **Fermenters**: Sized to accommodate 750ml batches
- **Thermometers**: To monitor mash temperatures
- **Hydrometers**: To measure specific gravity
- **Siphons/Tubing**: For transferring liquids
- **Sanitizer**: To clean and sanitize all equipment

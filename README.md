### Equipment

- **Bottles**: 750ml bottles
- **Large Pot (Brew Kettle)**: 8-quart capacity
- **Fermenters**: Sized to accommodate 750ml batches
- **Thermometers**: To monitor mash temperatures
- **Hydrometers**: To measure specific gravity
- **Siphons/Tubing**: For transferring liquids
- **Sanitizer**: To clean and sanitize all equipment

### Brewing Process

1. **Preparation and Mashing**
   - Clean and sanitize all equipment thoroughly.
   - Use filtered or spring water to avoid impurities.
   - Combine the grains for each batch as listed above in the brew pot.
   - Add 0.5 oz of rice hulls per beverage to prevent a stuck mash.
   - Heat 1.5 gallons of water to 162째F (72째C) and add to the grains, maintaining a mash temperature of 148째F (64째C) for 60 minutes.

2. **Oat-Based IPA Brew (Batch 2)**
   - For the Oat-Based IPA, brew a separate mash with oats and the other grains.
   - **Lactose Addition**: Add 0.5 oz of lactose per gallon during the last 5 minutes of the boil for the Lactose Variant.

3. **Determining the Need for Glucoamylase Enzyme**
   - After 30 minutes of mashing, perform an iodine test by placing a small sample of wort on a white plate and adding a drop of iodine solution.
   - If the iodine turns blue/purple, indicating incomplete starch conversion, consider adding glucoamylase enzyme.
   - If the iodine remains amber, starch conversion is complete.

4. **Monitoring Starch Conversion**
   - Continue monitoring starch conversion with periodic iodine tests until the iodine remains amber.

5. **Dividing the Recipe**
   - Divide the mash into separate containers for hopping and non-hopping processes.

6. **Boiling and Hopping (for Hopped Brews)**
   - Boil the mash and add 0.17 oz Liberty hops during the last 15 minutes.

7. **Cooling and Fermentation Preparation**
   - Cool the mash to room temperature.
   - Measure the Original Gravity (OG) using a hydrometer:
     - Aim for an OG of 1.080 for wine-like strength (10-12% ABV).
     - Aim for an OG of 1.050 for brew-like strength (5-7% ABV).
   - Adjust sugar content if necessary to reach the desired OG.
   - Divide the cooled mash into three 750ml portions.

8. **Yeast Pitching**
   - Add Champagne yeast (WLP715) to the first portion for Sparkling Beverage.
   - Add Cream Ale yeast blend (WLP080) to the second portion for Hopped Brews.

9. **Fermentation**
   - Transfer each portion into separate fermenters with airlocks.
   - Maintain a consistent fermentation temperature appropriate for the yeast strain used.
   - Allow fermentation to proceed until specific gravity stabilizes.

10. **Measuring and Aiming for Final Gravity (FG)**
    - Once fermentation is complete, measure the Final Gravity (FG) using a hydrometer.
    - For Sparkling Beverage, aim for an FG that achieves 10-12% ABV.
    - For Hopped Brews, aim for an FG that achieves 5-7% ABV.

11. **Priming and Bottling**
    - Add 0.75 oz of priming sugar to the entire batch.
    - Carefully siphon each portion into 750ml bottles, leaving sediment behind.
    - Seal each bottle tightly.

12. **Conditioning**
    - Store bottles in a dark place at room temperature for 1-2 weeks for carbonation.
    - Check pressure periodically.

13. **Serving**
    - Once carbonation is achieved, chill the bottles in the refrigerator.
    - Serve cold to minimize foaming.

### Wort and Hopping Quantities

- **Wort Preparation**: Approximately 1.5 gallons of wort is prepared for each batch.
- **Hopping Quantities**: For the Hopped Briess Pilsen Malt Brew, use 0.17 oz of Liberty hops during the last 15 minutes of the boil.

### Bottling

For a total yield of 1.5 gallons, you will need approximately 8 bottles per batch of 750ml each. Adjust the number of bottles based on the exact yield and desired serving size.
